# Portfolio Website

## Description
This portfolio website is designed using *Flexbox* and *CSS Grid* to create a structured, responsive layout. It includes sections for *About*, *Portfolio*, and *Contact* while maintaining a clean and modern design.

## Layout Approach
- *Flexbox*: Used for the navigation bar and footer to align elements horizontally.
- *CSS Grid*: Used in the Portfolio section to arrange projects in a responsive grid format.
  
## Responsive Design Techniques
- *Media Queries*: Applied for different screen sizes:
  - @media (max-width: 768px): Adjusts grid layout and navigation for tablets.
  - @media (max-width: 480px): Stacks elements vertically for better mobile readability.
- *Flexible Images & Text*: Ensures content scales properly on all devices.

## Deployment
This project is hosted on *GitHub Pages* / *Vercel*:
